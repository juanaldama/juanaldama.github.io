				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> One thing that I learned from this article is the power of the mind to connect the dots
							without even knowing. The principles presented in the article were ones I had never known of
							before, but they still made plenty sense and were things I had passively noticed in websites
							and design. I think that it is really cool the way the mind is able to piece things together
							on its own.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was the section about closure. Like I mentioned before, the
							mind is able to fill in the gaps without even really thinking about it and I think that
							psychology is super interesting. It really puts an emphasis on the importance of white and
							negative space, and how that works on your brain. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Your brain is always trying to make sense of the world by comparing previous experiences or
							visual patterns and connecting the dots. It has its own “weird” way of perceiving shape and
							form, grouping information, fill in the gaps to draw the big picture."</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p>6/10</p>
