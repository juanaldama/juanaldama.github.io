						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> One thing I learned fromt his article is that companies and corporations are not your
							friend. In this article alone, I learned about several different techniques that they use to
							mislead you in order to benefit themselves. It really made me think about the ethical side
							of design and how important it is for designers to be transparent and honest with users.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was the section where they talked about the solutions to
							dark patterns. It was super cool to read how understangin cognitive science can help you
							have a better user experience. The matrix also is really interesting to me, as it sort of
							highlights the complexities between reponsible and ethical designs.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Despite these possible solutions, there is still a gap. It is the designerâ€™s moral code.
							The implications of the products they create needs to be considered." </p>
					</li>
