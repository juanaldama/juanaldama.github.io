						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> One thing I learned from this article is just how much of a science typography is. I never
							truly realized just how much goes into selecting a font, size, color, and everything else.
							I feel like in the past when I had to select a font for a project, I just eyeballed it,
							along with the secondary fonts and the sizes too. After reading this article, I realize that
							there is quite a bit to consider to ensure that the user reading a webpage has a smooth
							experience. Another unique thing I learned, is that there exists so many unique resorces for
							fonts, not just to find new fonts, but also to find ones that go well together, and for
							general inspiration</p>
					</li>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I think my favorite part of this article was when it touched on identifying your audience and
							the importance of doing so. It's something that I have always overlooked, but just something
							as simple as making sure to tailor font to your audience, such as a very young or senior
							auidence. At the end of the day, the goal is to connect with your users, and so a website
							should use every means to do so, especially the font. That overall idea was my favorite part
							of the article.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Typography is all about experimentation. Itâ€™s both a science and an art." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
