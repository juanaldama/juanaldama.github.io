				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I feel like one thing I learned from this article is the amount of detail that goes into
							making sure an animation fits into your website. I feel like when an animation does not fit
							in an app that I am using, it easy for me to tell, cause it strangely stands out. However,
							for the animations that do fit, it feels super seamless to the point where I do not even
							think about. After reading this article, I realize that all of these animation principles
							are the ones that work to make it seamless and thoughtless for the user, while still looking
							good.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the artcle was the part of easing in and out. I found it really cool to
							be able to visualize each animation style with the graph, and I was trying to go through
							each one and picture in my head what it would look like. I also really liked how it was
							mentioned what each one is best used for.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "For the animation not to look mechanical and artificial, the object should move with some
							acceleration or deceleration â€” just like all live objects in the physical world." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
