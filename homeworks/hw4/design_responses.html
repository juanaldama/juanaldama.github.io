				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> One thing that I learned from this particle is the amount of regualtion that accesiblity
							laws have. I kind of knew a little about what accesibility standards pertained to, but to
							see the concrete examples, like the section 508 and W3C, really puts it into perspective. I
							believe that now knowing some of these standards will make it easier for me to see them in
							my every day life, and recognize them as accesibility practices. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was the example they used about the colored labels. I think
							it was realy fascinating to see a quick and easy alternative for those that may have
							difficulty differentiating between colors, with the textures. The emphasis on providing
							options like textures or patterns in graphs and charts is honestly a really thoughtful
							approach, and it ensures that information is accessible to everyone.
						</p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>"As designers, developers, and general tech people, we have the power to create a web weâ€™re
							all proud of: an inclusive web made for and consumable by all people."</p>
