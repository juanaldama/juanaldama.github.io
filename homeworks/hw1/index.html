    <h1>Juan Aldama</h1>

    <em>EECS 2024</em>

    <p>Hi! My name is Juan Aldama, and I am currently a senior at the University of California, Berkeley.
        Outside of class, I really really enjoy listening to music, playing/watching basketball, working out, and
        sleeping.
        This semester, I am very excited to enjoy my last couple of months at Berkeley, and try a bunch of things that I
        haven't
        throughout my time at Cal. I joined the airBears skydiving club, so that is at the very very top of my list.

        <li>One thing I learned from this article was the importance the wording in your application. It really is
            something
            may be easily overlooked while you use an app, but it certainly takes a good amount of time to perfect the
            text.
            For example, the AirBNB search bar having a city, instead of just blank, really goes a long way to make
            users
            think about all the places they could be at.
        </li>
        <li>My favorite part of the article was the GIFs that were inlcuded. I really liked how the apps used were apps
            that
            are super popular, and so we as the users might used to scrolling through and getting to where we want to go
            in
            an app, but decomposing it slowly like that really made me think about each component and why it was made
            the way
            it was.
        </li>
        <li>"You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product. "</li>
        <li>I would give this article a 8/10.</li>
