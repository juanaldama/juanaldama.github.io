                        <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                        <p> Despite there being no words in this article, I believe that I still learned quite a bit.
                            Within this article, there are so many unique and interesting style choices at play, that
                            make use of design and programming to make it cool for the user. Overall, I think what I
                            learned the most is the importance of seamless animations and transitions, as they
                            contribute a lot to the feeling of a well made website/applciation, and positively impacts
                            the experience of the user.

                    <li>
                        <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                        <p> I really liked the Travel Map animation. I think the reason that this is my favorite part is
                            because it such a small thing that really serves nothing to what I imagine the app is: a
                            map. It's little things like that, that are sprinkled across applications that really make
                            an application feel like it is super refined. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how
                            the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                        <p> I touched on my favorite in the last question, so I will choose another. I enjoyed the
                            selcted works transitions, because I believe it really fits with the theme of the intention
                            of the page. As a page for ast showcase, these transitions help elevate the art pieces
                            themselves, and make the entire website feel much more polished. Personally, I love
                            transitions, so the little things really go a long way for me in enjoying a website.
                            Additionally, maybe the programmer could work in conjuction with the artist to decide
                            exactly how they want their transtions to happen, furthering the artisitic showcase and
                            elevating the art as a whole! </p>

                        <p> 10, because there was no words, and each example was honestly really unique and hopefully I
                            could use some as inspiration in the future. </p>
